Subsequently, the user specified the desire for a sidebar with the navlinks: home, about, and contact. The AI then presented a list of additional features for potential implementation, including an expandable user profile section, a live feed of recent Ethereum transactions for the homepage, a detailed 'About' page with FAQs on Ethereum, a contact form with CAPTCHA verification, a dark/light mode toggle, and a notification bell for real-time alerts. However, not all features were marked for inclusion. The user was also presented with questions regarding preferences for the sidebar's design, specifically whether it should be collapsible or fixed and its position on the screen. The AI acknowledged the idea of adding a sidebar with the requested navlinks.
